Get Started
Below are example code snippets for a few use cases. For additional information about Azure AI Inference SDK, see full documentation  and samples .

1. Authentication using API Key
For Serverless API Endpoints, deploy the Model to generate the endpoint URL and an API key to authenticate against the service. In this sample endpoint and key are strings holding the endpoint URL and the API Key.

The API endpoint URL and API key can be found on the Deployments + Endpoint page once the model is deployed.

Azure inferencing package includes a client for Chat Completion, ChatCompletionsClient. A client can be authenticated using the API key. The code sample creates and authenticates a synchronous ChatCompletionsClient:

from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

# For Serverless API or Managed Compute endpoints
client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint="https://rahilhub012066462125.services.ai.azure.com/models",
    credential=AzureKeyCredential("<API_KEY>"),
    api_version="2024-05-01-preview"
)

2. Install dependencies
Install the Azure AI Inference SDK using pip (Requires: Python >=3.8):

pip install azure-ai-inference

3. Run a basic code sample
This sample demonstrates a basic call to the chat completion API. The call is synchronous.

import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "https://rahilhub012066462125.services.ai.azure.com/models"
model_name = "DeepSeek-R1"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential("<API_KEY>"),
    api_version="2024-05-01-preview"
)

response = client.complete(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="I am going to Paris, what should I see?"),
    ],
    max_tokens=2048,
    model=model_name
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

4. Explore more samples
Run a multi-turn conversation
This sample demonstrates a multi-turn conversation with the chat completion API. When using the model for a chat application, you'll need to manage the history of that conversation and send the latest messages to the model.

import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import AssistantMessage, SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "https://rahilhub012066462125.services.ai.azure.com/models"
model_name = "DeepSeek-R1"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential("<API_KEY>"),
    api_version="2024-05-01-preview"
)

response = client.complete(
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="I am going to Paris, what should I see?"),
        AssistantMessage(content="Paris, the capital of France, is known for its stunning architecture, art museums, historical landmarks, and romantic atmosphere. Here are some of the top attractions to see in Paris:\n \n 1. The Eiffel Tower: The iconic Eiffel Tower is one of the most recognizable landmarks in the world and offers breathtaking views of the city.\n 2. The Louvre Museum: The Louvre is one of the world's largest and most famous museums, housing an impressive collection of art and artifacts, including the Mona Lisa.\n 3. Notre-Dame Cathedral: This beautiful cathedral is one of the most famous landmarks in Paris and is known for its Gothic architecture and stunning stained glass windows.\n \n These are just a few of the many attractions that Paris has to offer. With so much to see and do, it's no wonder that Paris is one of the most popular tourist destinations in the world."),
        UserMessage(content="What is so great about #1?")
    ],
    max_tokens=2048,
    model=model_name
)

print(response.choices[0].message.content)

Stream the output
For a better user experience, you will want to stream the response of the model so that the first token shows up early and you avoid waiting for long responses.

import os
from azure.ai.inference import ChatCompletionsClient
from azure.ai.inference.models import SystemMessage, UserMessage
from azure.core.credentials import AzureKeyCredential

endpoint = "https://rahilhub012066462125.services.ai.azure.com/models"
model_name = "DeepSeek-R1"

client = ChatCompletionsClient(
    endpoint=endpoint,
    credential=AzureKeyCredential("<API_KEY>"),
    api_version="2024-05-01-preview"
)

response = client.complete(
    stream=True,
    messages=[
        SystemMessage(content="You are a helpful assistant."),
        UserMessage(content="I am going to Paris, what should I see?")
    ],
    max_tokens=2048,
    model=model_name
)

for update in response:
    if update.choices:
        print(update.choices[0].delta.content or "", end="")

client.close()
