But my OPT/CPT will only allow me to have Start Date = June 23rd and End Date = August 8th. 


Reason: The university has informed me that they cannot approve the current dates listed in the offer letter, as the internship must conclude before the start of the Fall 2025 semester. According to their guidelines, the final allowable date for the internship is August 8, 2025..        


Can I still join a cohort, but not tell my university?  - Can I get in trouble for this situation? 


Answer: If your CPT/OPT date is within 1 week or so around our cohort date. It’s fine. If it cuts off in the middle of the cohort. We have to move you to the future cohort. 


2. Who will pay for services that require pay during the internship? 
   1. Example - API services or Cloud services for the AI product? 
   2. Example - Need compute for FineTuning a model? 


Answer: Our company or the product managers in the same team will cover the cloud and API cost. But we will not cover the computer device cost. 


3. I will be traveling to visit my family from the USA to India, China, etc…. Can I use this OPT/CPT work permit for reentry into the USA? 


Answer: We don’t know, please contact your immigration lawyer.
