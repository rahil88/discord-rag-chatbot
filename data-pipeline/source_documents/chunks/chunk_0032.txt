4. Standard response for CPT/OPT process in the program: 
For interns' CPT and OPT sponsorship concerns, please follow the steps below:     
**1. Consult Your School First**
Please speak with your school’s international student office to understand their specific requirements for CPT or OPT authorization. They will inform you what documentation or updates are needed from our side (e.g., offer letter, company info, etc.).


**2. Offer Letter Timing**
We are able to revise your offer letter based on your CPT/OPT dates. However, we ask that your start and end dates align as closely as possible with your assigned cohort timeline. A 1–2 week delay is acceptable if there are processing delays, but please keep us informed and send us any updated dates as soon as possible.


**3. E-Verify Requirements**
We will also need your information to validate your eligibility to work in the U.S. through the E-Verify system. Please follow the steps here: https://discord.com/channels/1255183088607297729/1283485753782964316/1293422029298471007


Please make sure to send/share your full legal name in your offer letter.
