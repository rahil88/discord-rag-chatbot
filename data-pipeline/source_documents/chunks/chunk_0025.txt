AI Engineer Group Interview and FAQ 
- PM Accelerator 






Overview of the AI Engineer Internship Process:
1. Introduction and Setup:
   * The video begins with Dr. Nancy Li conducting a group interview for an AI engineer internship. Due to high demand, she explains how the Zoom meeting was initially limited to 100 participants but was later upgraded to accommodate more attendees.
2. Internship Structure:
   * The internship is unpaid but offers valuable hands-on experience in AI product development. Participants will work alongside product managers (PMs) and other engineers to build real-life AI products.
   * The teams consist of software developers, data scientists, and product managers. The internship includes working on tasks like voice of customer interviews, MVP development, and go-to-market strategies.
